# Xavier O'Keefe PORTFOLIO
Hello! Here is a collection of my personal projects. Some are larger, some are smaller. The smaller ones will be grouped in a folder with the name of the language they were written in, and the larger ones will have a link to their source repo.

## Arduino
- Contains two projects, one for my freshman project and one for personal development

## C++
- This contains my CSCI 2270 (Data Structures) final project, a bogosort script, as well as my own sudoku solver that I made for fun. Most of my work in C++ has been for classes/work so I am unable to share it.

## Joystick-Analyzer
- I developed this program to analyze data from an experiment with CASA. Written in C++. More info available in the repo's own README

## Pay-form-automation
- Filling out timesheets was incredibly tedious, so I wrote a program in Python to automate this process. More info available in the repo's own README

## Python
- Contains a several python projects, some for robosub, some for fun
- These are smaller examples, I am unable to post most of my current non-personal work

## Scripting
- Contains a script written for a client
- This program found and replaced every instance of a string in an entire directory, saving my client minutes with every use

## iOS
- iOS app development. Currently one memory card game, but I have another app releasing on the App store soon!
