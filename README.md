<h1>Xavier O'Keefe PORTFOLIO</h1>
Hello! Here is a collection of my personal projects. Each folder will contain files with its corresponding document type and documentation about each program. 

<h2>Python</h2>
- Contains a several python projects, some for robosub, some for personal use

<h2>Arduino</h2>
- Contains two projects, one for my freshman class and one for personal development

<h2>Scripting</h2>
- Contains a script written for a client

<h2>Where is the C++??</h2>
- My resume says that I know C++, so where is it? Most of my C++ experience has come from my coursework at CU Boulder. This means that most of my C++ coding has been written in homework documents that are not entirely my own work. I do not feel comfortable advertising myself with this work, thus the omission. <br/>
- I am currently in a data structures course, where we code exclusively in C++. This means that I have a solid understanding of the implementation of linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash maps.
