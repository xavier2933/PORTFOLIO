<h1>Xavier O'Keefe PORTFOLIO</h1>
Hello! Here is a collection of my personal projects. Each folder will contain files with its corresponding document type and documentation about each program. 

<h2>Python</h2>
- Contains a several python projects, some for robosub, some for personal use

<h2>Arduino</h2>
- Contains two projects, one for my freshman class and one for personal development

<h2>Scripting</h2>
- Contains a script written for a client

<h2>C++</h2>
- Most of my experience with C++ has come from courses at CU Boulder, so there is not much work that I am able to share in C++. I have added my final project for Data Structures, which involved using both open addressing and chaining collision adressing tactics for hash tables, as well as inserting/searching a binary tree. This class covered linked lists, binary search trees, graphs, and hash tables, meaning I have experience implementing all of these in C++.
