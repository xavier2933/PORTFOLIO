<h2>HashChaining.cpp/.h</h2>
- These files create a hash table, insert info from data files, and insert these data into a table using chaining. I then insert this data into a Binary Search Tree and search it.I wrote all of the code in the .cpp file, and was 
provided with the .h file to base my code on.

<h2>HashOpenAddressing.cpp/.h</h2>
- These files create a hash table, insert info from data files, and insert these data into a table using open addressing (quadratic probing) to address collsions. I then insert this data into a Binary Search Tree and search it. I wrote all of
of the code in the .cpp file, and was given the .h file to base my code on.

<h2>BST.cpp/.h</h2>
- In these files I create a Binary Search Tree, as well as fucntions to search for data in it. I wrote all of the code in the .cpp file, but was given the .h files to base my code off of.

<h2>.csv files</h2>
- These files were provided as examples to test code on.
