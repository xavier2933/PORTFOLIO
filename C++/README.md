# C++ code
Hello! This is the folder where I will place C++ code. I have lots of other experience in 
C++, however this has mostly come in the form of homework assignments for various classes. This means I can not share them here.

## CSCI 2270 final project
- In this project I use both open addressing and chaining to address collisons in hash tables. I also use Binary Search Trees to store data and access this data.

## Sudoku solver
- Inspired by my discrete math class, this solver will solve any sudoku, if possible

## Bogosort
- Bogosort is a sorting algorithm that randomizes an array until it is sorted from least to greatest
- This code has methods for timing this sort and reporting the average time to sort over n trials
