<h1>C++ code</h1>
Hello! This is the folder where I will place C++ code. Currently there is only my Data Structures project, which was completed December 2022. I have lots of other experience in 
C++, however this has mostly come in the form of homework assignments for various classes. This means I can not share them here. I plan to undertake a new project in C++ in the near
future, hopefully in early 2023.

<h2>CSCI 2270 final project</h2>
- In this project I use both open addressing and chaining to address collisons in hash tables. I also use Binary Search Trees to store data and access this data.
