<h1>Scripting</h1>
  - While I do not have a ton of experience scripting, it is definitely an area I am looking to learn more about
<h2>find_replace.ps1</h2>
  - I developed this script for a client to use in his daily business. This involved tailoring the program to his specific needs, as well as providing a detailed and informative user's manual.<br>
  - This script allows my client to find every instance of a word in a given directory (even recursively), and then replace this word.
  - I used windows Forms and a powershell script to make an intuitive GUI, which greatly increased user feedback and allowed the process to be conducted quicker
