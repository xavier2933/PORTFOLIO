<h1>Arduino Projects</h1>
  - Here are my most notable projects with Arduino

<h2>testlight.ino</h2>
  - This script was developed to gdt more familiar with ROS and gain exposure in the Arduino environment <br>
  - This script reads data from a light sensor and publishes this data to a ROS topic <br>
  - The script also subscribes to this data (as a proof-of-concept) and turns on an LED if light levels are low enough <br>
<h2>voltage_reader_4.ino</h2>
  - This script was developed for my freshman project. <br>
  - Took data from our generator, converted it to voltage and wattage, and outputted these results to an LCD screen <br>
