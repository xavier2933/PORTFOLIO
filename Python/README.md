# Python Folder
- Here you will find a selection of my favorite Python projects.

## F22/23 gradeCalc.py
- Grade calculators for my finals in fall of 2022 and fall of 2023. I think it's interesting to see how my code has improved and the different ways I approached the problems.
  
## square.py
- I developed this for the Colorado Robosub club
- This was my first piece of code that actually controlled the sub

## linefollower.py
- Developed for Colorado Robosub, this code would allow us to follow a line autonomously
- Used the library pillow to identify which pixels were red, then used this data to track where the line was and feed this information to the sub.

## fishtank.py
- Used bext to create a virtual fish tank

## sortbot.py
- Sorts a directory by file type
- This program has actually proved to be very useful, I like having folder organized by file types more than I expected
