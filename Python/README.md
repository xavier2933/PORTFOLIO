<h1>Python Folder</h1>
- Here you will find a selection of my favorite Python projects.

<h2>square.py</h2>
- I developed this for the Colorado Robosub club
- This was my first piece of code that actually controlled the sub

<h2>linefollower.py</h2>
- Developed for Colorado Robosub, this code would allow us to follow a line autonomously
- Used the library pillow to identify which pixels were red, then used this data to track where the line was and feed this information to the sub.

<h2>fishtank.py</h2>
- Used bext to create a virtual fish tank

<h2>gradecalculator.py</h2>
- I initially developed this program for a class that had locked grades in canvas, but I later modified it to serve as a real final grade calculator
- This program has already saved me a ton of time.

<h2>sortbot.py</h2>
- Sorts a directory by file type
- This program has actually proved to be very useful, I like having folder organized by file types more than I expected
